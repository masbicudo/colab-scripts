# colab-scripts - Google Colab helper scripts

Google Colab is an online collaborative coding notebook system that runs inside on demand virtual machines.
It has a lot of useful features such as accelerator hardware, forms, LaTeX, and so on.
It also lets the user run shell commands and has some integration with GitHub and services from Google.
This repository targets these integration paths to further improve Google Colab capabilities:

- Notebooks in languages other than Python
  - Julia: https://colab.research.google.com/github/masbicudo/colab-scripts/blob/main/julia.ipynb#scrollTo=JuliaInstall
  - Julia with GPU enabled: https://colab.research.google.com/github/masbicudo/colab-scripts/blob/main/julia-gpu.ipynb#scrollTo=JuliaInstall
